          "q": "How does Toolaze compress images without uploading them?",
          "a": "Toolaze uses WebAssembly and browser-based image processing APIs to compress images directly in your browser. Your files are processed locally on your device, never sent to any server. This ensures complete privacy and faster processing."
        },
        {
          "q": "What image formats does Toolaze support?",
          "a": "Currently, our Image Compressor supports JPG, PNG, and WEBP formats. We're working on adding support for more formats including HEIC, BMP, and TIFF in future updates."
        },
        {
          "q": "Is there a file size limit?",
          "a": "There's no theoretical file size limit. However, very large images may cause browser slowdown depending on your device's performance and available memory. We recommend processing large files in smaller batches for the best experience."
        },
        {
          "q": "Will Toolaze always be free?",
          "a": "Yes! Toolaze is committed to providing free tools forever. We believe in making powerful image processing tools accessible to everyone without any cost barriers or premium subscriptions."
        },
        {
          "q": "How much can I compress my images?",
          "a": "Compression results vary depending on the original image quality and format. Typically, you can achieve 50-90% size reduction while maintaining acceptable visual quality. You can adjust compression settings to find the perfect balance for your needs."
