        "text": "PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is a lossless format that preserves perfect image quality and supports full transparency with alpha channels, making it ideal for graphics, logos, and images requiring pixel-perfect accuracy. However, PNG files are significantly larger—often 2-5 times bigger than equivalent JPG files—which can slow down website loading times, consume excessive storage space, and increase bandwidth costs. JPG (JPEG) uses lossy compression optimized for photographs and complex images, achieving 50-80% smaller file sizes while maintaining visually acceptable quality for most use cases. JPG doesn't support transparency, but for photographs and images without transparent backgrounds, JPG offers the perfect balance between quality and file size."

JPG format is universally supported across all platforms and devices, making it the standard choice for web images, social media uploads, and digital photography where file size optimization matters more than perfect pixel-level accuracy."

  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "Will I lose transparency when converting PNG to JPG?",
      "a": "Yes, JPG format doesn't support transparency. When you convert PNG to JPG, any transparent areas in your PNG image will be filled with a solid color background (typically white). If your PNG image has transparency that you need to preserve, you should keep it in PNG format or use a format that supports transparency like PNG or WebP. However, for photographs and images without transparent backgrounds, converting to JPG is ideal for file size optimization."
    },
    {
      "q": "How much smaller will JPG files be compared to PNG?",
      "a": "JPG files are typically 50-80% smaller than PNG files. For example, a 2MB PNG photograph might become a 400KB-1MB JPG file, depending on the image content and compression settings. This dramatic size reduction makes JPG ideal for web use, where faster loading times and reduced bandwidth are priorities. However, the exact reduction varies based on image complexity—photographs with many colors compress better than simple graphics with few colors."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will converting PNG to JPG reduce image quality?",
      "a": "JPG uses lossy compression, which means some quality loss occurs during conversion. However, for photographs and complex images, the quality loss is usually minimal and visually imperceptible at normal viewing sizes. The trade-off is worth it for the significant file size reduction. For simple graphics, logos, or images with text, PNG might be better to preserve sharp edges and perfect quality. Toolaze uses optimized compression algorithms to maintain the best possible quality while achieving maximum file size reduction."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is PNG to JPG conversion free and secure?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze is completely free forever with no hidden costs, subscriptions, or advertisements. Most importantly, all conversion happens locally in your browser using client-side technology. Your PNG files never leave your device—they're never uploaded to any server, ensuring 100% privacy and security for your images."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I convert multiple PNG files to JPG at once?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze supports batch conversion of up to 100 PNG files per session. You can drag and drop multiple PNG files at once, and they'll all be converted to JPG format simultaneously. There are no individual file size limits, so you can convert large PNG files without restrictions."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will my EXIF data be preserved when converting PNG to JPG?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze preserves all EXIF metadata during conversion, including GPS coordinates, shooting date, camera settings, and other metadata tags. Your converted JPG files will retain all the original metadata from your PNG files, ensuring no information is lost during conversion."
    },
    {
      "q": "What's the difference between PNG and JPG format?",
      "a": "PNG uses lossless compression, preserving perfect quality but creating larger files (typically 2-5 times larger than JPG). PNG fully supports transparency with alpha channels, making it ideal for graphics and logos. JPG uses lossy compression optimized for photographs, achieving 50-80% smaller file sizes while maintaining visually acceptable quality. JPG doesn't support transparency but is perfect for photographs and web images where file size optimization is important."
