        "title": "WebP vs JPG: Compatibility and Support Differences",
        "text": "WebP is Google's modern image format that offers superior compression—typically 25-35% smaller file sizes than JPG while maintaining similar visual quality. WebP supports both lossy and lossless compression, transparency, and animation, making it an excellent choice for modern web applications. However, WebP has significant compatibility limitations: older browsers (especially Internet Explorer), legacy software applications, email clients, and many mobile apps don't support WebP format, causing images to fail displaying or requiring fallback formats. JPG (JPEG) is the universal standard that works on virtually every device, platform, application, and browser—from the oldest systems to the newest—ensuring your images display correctly everywhere without compatibility issues."

        "title": "Why Convert WebP to JPG?",
        "text": "Converting WebP to JPG becomes necessary when you need to ensure images work on older browsers and legacy systems, want to share images via email clients that don't support WebP, need to use images in software applications that require JPG format, or want maximum compatibility for cross-platform sharing. JPG format guarantees that your images will display correctly on any device, in any application, and on any platform, making it the safest choice for universal image sharing, archiving, and compatibility-critical use cases where format support cannot be assumed."

    {
      "q": "Why do I need to convert WebP to JPG?",
      "a": "WebP format offers excellent compression but has limited compatibility. Many older browsers (especially Internet Explorer), email clients, legacy software applications, and mobile apps don't support WebP, causing images to fail displaying. JPG is the universal standard that works on virtually every device, browser, and application worldwide, ensuring your images display correctly everywhere without compatibility issues."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will converting WebP to JPG reduce image quality?",
      "a": "JPG uses lossy compression, so some quality loss occurs during conversion. However, for most photographs and complex images, the quality loss is minimal and visually imperceptible at normal viewing sizes. Toolaze uses optimized compression algorithms to maintain the best possible quality while ensuring universal compatibility. The trade-off is worth it for guaranteed compatibility across all platforms and devices."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I convert WebP images with transparency to JPG?",
      "a": "Yes, you can convert WebP images with transparency to JPG, but JPG format doesn't support transparency. When converting, transparent areas will be filled with a solid color background (typically white). If you need to preserve transparency, consider converting to PNG format instead, which supports full alpha channel transparency."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is WebP to JPG conversion free and secure?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze is completely free forever with no hidden costs, subscriptions, or advertisements. Most importantly, all conversion happens locally in your browser using client-side technology. Your WebP files never leave your device—they're never uploaded to any server, ensuring 100% privacy and security for your images."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I convert multiple WebP files to JPG at once?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze supports batch conversion of up to 100 WebP files per session. You can drag and drop multiple WebP files at once, and they'll all be converted to JPG format simultaneously. There are no individual file size limits, so you can convert large WebP files without restrictions."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will my EXIF data be preserved when converting WebP to JPG?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze preserves all EXIF metadata during conversion, including GPS coordinates, shooting date, camera settings, and other metadata tags. Your converted JPG files will retain all the original metadata from your WebP files."
    },
    {
      "q": "What's the difference between WebP and JPG format?",
      "a": "WebP is Google's modern format offering 25-35% better compression than JPG with similar quality, and supports transparency and animation. However, WebP has limited compatibility—many older browsers, email clients, and applications don't support it. JPG is the universal standard that works everywhere, uses lossy compression optimized for photographs, and doesn't support transparency, but guarantees compatibility across all platforms and devices."
