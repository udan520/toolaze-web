However, HEIC files are primarily supported on Apple devices and newer systems. JPG (JPEG) is the universal standard that works on virtually every device, platform, and application worldwide, making it the go-to format for sharing, uploading, and compatibility."

      "q": "What is the difference between HEIC and JPG format?",
      "a": "HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) is Apple's modern format that offers better compression (up to 50% smaller files) and superior image quality compared to JPG. However, HEIC is primarily supported on Apple devices and newer systems. JPG is the universal standard that works on virtually every device, platform, and application, making it ideal for sharing and compatibility across different systems."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why do I need to convert HEIC to JPG?",
      "a": "Converting HEIC to JPG is essential when sharing photos with Windows users, uploading to websites or social media platforms that don't support HEIC, emailing images without compatibility issues, or using photos in applications that require JPG format. JPG ensures your images are accessible everywhere without conversion barriers."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will converting HEIC to JPG reduce image quality?",
      "a": "Toolaze uses advanced conversion algorithms to maintain the highest possible image quality during HEIC to JPG conversion. While JPG is a lossy format, our converter preserves visual fidelity and ensures your converted images look virtually identical to the original HEIC files, with minimal quality loss."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I convert HEIC files on Windows without installing software?",
      "a": "Yes! Toolaze is a browser-based converter that works entirely in your web browser. You don't need to install any software or plugins. Simply open Toolaze in your browser, upload your HEIC files, and convert them to JPG instantly—no downloads or installations required."
    },
    {
      "q": "How many HEIC files can I convert at once?",
      "a": "Toolaze supports batch conversion of up to 100 HEIC files per session. You can drag and drop multiple files at once, and they'll all be converted to JPG format simultaneously. There are no individual file size limits, so you can convert large HEIC files without restrictions."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will I lose my photo's GPS and time information when converting?",
      "a": "No. Toolaze preserves all EXIF metadata, including GPS coordinates, shooting date, camera settings, and location tags. Your converted JPG files will retain all the original metadata from your HEIC files, ensuring no information is lost during conversion."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is HEIC to JPG conversion free and secure?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze is completely free forever with no hidden costs or ads. More importantly, all conversion happens locally in your browser using client-side technology. Your HEIC files never leave your device—they're never uploaded to any server, ensuring 100% privacy and security for your photos."
