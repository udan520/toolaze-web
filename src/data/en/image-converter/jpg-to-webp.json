        "text": "JPG (JPEG) is the universal standard format for photographs, using lossy compression optimized for complex images with many colors. JPG achieves good compression ratios and is supported everywhere, making it the default choice for digital photography and web images. However, JPG compression technology is decades old and doesn't leverage modern algorithms. WebP is Google's advanced image format that uses superior compression algorithms, achieving 25-30% better compression than JPG while maintaining similar or better visual quality. WebP supports both lossy and lossless compression, can handle transparency (though JPG doesn't), and is optimized for modern web use. WebP represents the next generation of image compression, offering better efficiency without sacrificing compatibility with modern browsers and devices."

WebP format delivers 25-30% smaller file sizes than JPG while maintaining excellent visual quality, making it ideal for modern web development, mobile apps, and digital platforms where performance and efficiency are priorities. WebP is supported by all modern browsers, ensuring compatibility while maximizing compression benefits."

    {
      "q": "Is WebP better than JPG for compression?",
      "a": "Yes, WebP offers 25-30% better compression than JPG while maintaining similar or better visual quality. WebP uses advanced compression algorithms developed by Google, making it more efficient than the decades-old JPG compression technology. For modern web applications and mobile apps, WebP provides significant benefits in file size reduction without noticeable quality loss."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will converting JPG to WebP reduce image quality?",
      "a": "WebP uses lossy compression similar to JPG, so some quality loss occurs during conversion. However, WebP's advanced algorithms typically produce better quality at the same file size compared to JPG, or similar quality at smaller file sizes. For most photographs and complex images, the quality loss is minimal and visually imperceptible at normal viewing sizes. Toolaze uses optimized compression settings to maintain the best possible quality while achieving maximum file size reduction."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do all browsers support WebP format?",
      "a": "All modern browsers support WebP format, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Opera. WebP is also supported by all major mobile browsers. However, older browsers (especially Internet Explorer) don't support WebP. For maximum compatibility, you can use WebP with fallback to JPG for older browsers, or convert to JPG if you need universal compatibility."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is JPG to WebP conversion free and secure?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze is completely free forever with no hidden costs, subscriptions, or advertisements. Most importantly, all conversion happens locally in your browser using client-side technology. Your JPG files never leave your device—they're never uploaded to any server, ensuring 100% privacy and security for your images."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I convert multiple JPG files to WebP at once?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze supports batch conversion of up to 100 JPG files per session. You can drag and drop multiple JPG files at once, and they'll all be converted to WebP format simultaneously. There are no individual file size limits, so you can convert large JPG files without restrictions."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will my EXIF data be preserved when converting JPG to WebP?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze preserves all EXIF metadata during conversion, including GPS coordinates, shooting date, camera settings, and other metadata tags. Your converted WebP files will retain all the original metadata from your JPG files."
    },
    {
      "q": "What's the difference between JPG and WebP format?",
      "a": "JPG uses lossy compression optimized for photographs, resulting in good compression but using decades-old technology. JPG is universally supported but doesn't support transparency. WebP uses advanced compression algorithms, achieving 25-30% better compression than JPG with similar quality, supports both lossy and lossless compression, can handle transparency, and is optimized for modern web use. WebP is supported by all modern browsers and represents the next generation of image compression."
