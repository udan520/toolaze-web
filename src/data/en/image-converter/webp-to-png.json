        "text": "WebP is Google's modern image format that provides excellent compression—typically 25-35% smaller file sizes than PNG while maintaining similar quality. WebP supports both lossy and lossless compression, transparency with alpha channels, and animation, making it ideal for modern web applications. However, WebP has compatibility limitations: many older browsers, design software applications, and legacy systems don't support WebP format. PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is a lossless format that preserves perfect pixel-level quality, supports full alpha channel transparency, and has universal support across all platforms, design software, and applications. PNG is the industry standard for graphics, logos, icons, and images requiring transparency and lossless quality."

    {
      "q": "Will transparency be preserved when converting WebP to PNG?",
      "a": "Yes, PNG format fully supports transparency with alpha channels, so all transparent areas in your WebP images will be perfectly preserved when converting to PNG. If your WebP image has transparency, it will be maintained in the PNG output. This makes PNG ideal for graphics, logos, and images that need transparent backgrounds."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is WebP to PNG conversion lossless?",
      "a": "Yes, PNG is a lossless format, so converting WebP to PNG preserves perfect quality with zero compression artifacts or quality degradation. The conversion maintains pixel-perfect accuracy, making PNG ideal for graphics, logos, and images where quality is critical. However, note that PNG files are typically larger than WebP files because PNG uses lossless compression."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why convert WebP to PNG instead of keeping WebP?",
      "a": "While WebP offers excellent compression, it has compatibility limitations. Many design software applications, older browsers, and legacy systems don't support WebP format. PNG has universal support across all platforms, design software, and applications, making it the industry standard for graphics and images requiring transparency. Converting to PNG ensures your images work everywhere and maintain perfect quality."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is WebP to PNG conversion free and secure?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze is completely free forever with no hidden costs, subscriptions, or advertisements. Most importantly, all conversion happens locally in your browser using client-side technology. Your WebP files never leave your device—they're never uploaded to any server, ensuring 100% privacy and security for your images."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I convert multiple WebP files to PNG at once?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze supports batch conversion of up to 100 WebP files per session. You can drag and drop multiple WebP files at once, and they'll all be converted to PNG format simultaneously with transparency preservation. There are no individual file size limits, so you can convert large WebP files without restrictions."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will my EXIF data be preserved when converting WebP to PNG?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze preserves all EXIF metadata during conversion, including GPS coordinates, shooting date, camera settings, and other metadata tags. Your converted PNG files will retain all the original metadata from your WebP files."
    },
    {
      "q": "What's the difference between WebP and PNG format?",
      "a": "WebP is Google's modern format offering 25-35% better compression than PNG with similar quality, and supports both lossy and lossless compression, transparency, and animation. However, WebP has limited compatibility with older browsers and design software. PNG is a lossless format with universal support, perfect pixel-level quality preservation, and full alpha channel transparency, making it the industry standard for graphics and professional design work."
