        "text": "PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is a lossless format that preserves perfect pixel-level quality and supports full alpha channel transparency, making it ideal for graphics, logos, and images requiring transparency. However, PNG files are significantly larger—often 2-5 times bigger than equivalent WebP files—which can impact website loading speeds, increase bandwidth costs, and consume more storage space. WebP is Google's modern image format that provides 25-35% better compression than PNG while maintaining similar visual quality, supports both lossy and lossless compression, preserves transparency with alpha channels, and is supported by all modern browsers and mobile devices. WebP offers the perfect balance between PNG's quality and transparency features with significantly smaller file sizes."

    {
      "q": "Will transparency be preserved when converting PNG to WebP?",
      "a": "Yes, WebP format fully supports transparency with alpha channels, so all transparent areas in your PNG images will be perfectly preserved when converting to WebP. If your PNG image has transparency, it will be maintained in the WebP output, making WebP ideal for graphics and logos that need transparent backgrounds."
    },
    {
      "q": "How much smaller will WebP files be compared to PNG?",
      "a": "WebP files are typically 25-35% smaller than PNG files while maintaining similar visual quality. For example, a 2MB PNG graphic might become a 1.3-1.5MB WebP file. This significant size reduction makes WebP ideal for web use, where faster loading times and reduced bandwidth are priorities. The exact reduction varies based on image complexity—photographs and complex graphics compress better than simple graphics with few colors."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will converting PNG to WebP reduce image quality?",
      "a": "WebP supports both lossy and lossless compression. When converting PNG to WebP, you can achieve smaller file sizes with minimal quality loss that's usually visually imperceptible at normal viewing sizes. For graphics and images where quality is critical, WebP's lossless mode preserves perfect quality while still achieving some compression benefits. Toolaze uses optimized compression algorithms to maintain the best possible quality while achieving maximum file size reduction."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is PNG to WebP conversion free and secure?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze is completely free forever with no hidden costs, subscriptions, or advertisements. Most importantly, all conversion happens locally in your browser using client-side technology. Your PNG files never leave your device—they're never uploaded to any server, ensuring 100% privacy and security for your images."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I convert multiple PNG files to WebP at once?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze supports batch conversion of up to 100 PNG files per session. You can drag and drop multiple PNG files at once, and they'll all be converted to WebP format simultaneously with transparency preservation. There are no individual file size limits, so you can convert large PNG files without restrictions."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will my EXIF data be preserved when converting PNG to WebP?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze preserves all EXIF metadata during conversion, including GPS coordinates, shooting date, camera settings, and other metadata tags. Your converted WebP files will retain all the original metadata from your PNG files."
    },
    {
      "q": "What's the difference between PNG and WebP format?",
      "a": "PNG uses lossless compression, preserving perfect quality but creating larger files (typically 2-5 times larger than WebP). PNG fully supports transparency with alpha channels. WebP is Google's modern format offering 25-35% better compression than PNG with similar quality, supports both lossy and lossless compression, preserves transparency, and is supported by all modern browsers. WebP offers PNG's quality and transparency advantages with significantly smaller file sizes."
