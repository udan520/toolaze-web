        "text": "HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) is Apple's modern image format that uses advanced HEVC encoding to achieve 50% smaller file sizes compared to JPG while maintaining superior image quality. HEIC supports transparency, high dynamic range (HDR), and advanced features, making it ideal for Apple devices. However, HEIC has significant compatibility limitations: it's primarily supported on Apple devices and newer systems, causing issues when sharing with Windows users, uploading to websites, or using in applications that don't support HEIC. WebP is Google's modern image format that provides excellent compression—typically 25-35% better than JPG—supports both lossy and lossless compression, preserves transparency with alpha channels, and is supported by all modern browsers and mobile devices. WebP offers the perfect balance between HEIC's compression efficiency and universal compatibility."

    {
      "q": "Why convert HEIC to WebP instead of JPG?",
      "a": "WebP offers better compression than JPG (25-35% smaller files) while maintaining similar quality, and WebP supports transparency which JPG doesn't. WebP is also supported by all modern browsers, making it ideal for web use. While HEIC offers even better compression, it has limited compatibility. WebP provides the perfect balance between compression efficiency and universal browser support, making it ideal for modern web applications and mobile apps."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will transparency be preserved when converting HEIC to WebP?",
      "a": "Yes, WebP format fully supports transparency with alpha channels, so if your HEIC image has transparency, it will be perfectly preserved when converting to WebP. HEIC format supports transparency, and WebP preserves this feature, making WebP ideal for graphics, logos, and images that need transparent backgrounds from iPhone photos."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will converting HEIC to WebP reduce image quality?",
      "a": "WebP supports both lossy and lossless compression. When converting HEIC to WebP, you can achieve smaller file sizes with minimal quality loss that's usually visually imperceptible at normal viewing sizes. WebP's advanced compression algorithms typically produce excellent quality at smaller file sizes. For images where quality is critical, WebP's lossless mode preserves perfect quality while still achieving some compression benefits."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is HEIC to WebP conversion free and secure?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze is completely free forever with no hidden costs, subscriptions, or advertisements. Most importantly, all conversion happens locally in your browser using WebAssembly-powered HEVC decoder technology. Your HEIC files never leave your device—they're never uploaded to any server, ensuring 100% privacy and security for your iPhone photos."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I convert multiple HEIC files to WebP at once?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze supports batch conversion of up to 100 HEIC files per session. You can drag and drop multiple HEIC files at once, and they'll all be converted to WebP format simultaneously with transparency preservation. There are no individual file size limits, so you can convert large HEIC files without restrictions."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will my EXIF data be preserved when converting HEIC to WebP?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze preserves all EXIF metadata during conversion, including GPS coordinates, shooting date, camera settings, and other metadata tags. Your converted WebP files will retain all the original metadata from your HEIC files."
    },
    {
      "q": "What's the difference between HEIC and WebP format?",
      "a": "HEIC is Apple's modern format using HEVC encoding, offering 50% smaller files than JPG with superior quality, and supports transparency and HDR. However, HEIC has limited compatibility—primarily supported on Apple devices. WebP is Google's modern format offering 25-35% better compression than JPG, supports both lossy and lossless compression, preserves transparency, and is supported by all modern browsers.
