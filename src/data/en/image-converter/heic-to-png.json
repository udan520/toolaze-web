        "text": "HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) is Apple's modern image format that uses advanced HEVC encoding to achieve 50% smaller file sizes compared to JPG while maintaining superior image quality. HEIC supports transparency, high dynamic range (HDR), and advanced features, making it ideal for Apple devices. However, HEIC has significant compatibility limitations: it's primarily supported on Apple devices and newer systems, causing issues when sharing with Windows users, uploading to websites, or using in applications that don't support HEIC. PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is a lossless format that preserves perfect pixel-level quality, supports full alpha channel transparency, and has universal support across all platforms, design software, and applications. PNG is the industry standard for graphics, logos, and images requiring transparency and lossless quality."

PNG format guarantees pixel-perfect quality preservation, full transparency support, and universal compatibility, making it the preferred choice for graphic designers, web developers, and professionals who need transparency and quality without compromise, especially when working with iPhone photos that need to be used in professional workflows."

    {
      "q": "Will transparency be preserved when converting HEIC to PNG?",
      "a": "Yes, PNG format fully supports transparency with alpha channels, so if your HEIC image has transparency, it will be perfectly preserved when converting to PNG. HEIC format supports transparency, and PNG preserves this feature, making PNG ideal for graphics, logos, and images that need transparent backgrounds from iPhone photos."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is HEIC to PNG conversion lossless?",
      "a": "Yes, PNG is a lossless format, so converting HEIC to PNG preserves perfect quality with zero compression artifacts or quality degradation. The conversion maintains pixel-perfect accuracy, making PNG ideal for graphics, logos, and images where quality is critical. However, note that PNG files are typically larger than HEIC files because PNG uses lossless compression while HEIC uses advanced HEVC encoding."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why convert HEIC to PNG instead of JPG?",
      "a": "While JPG offers universal compatibility, PNG provides lossless quality preservation and full transparency support. If your HEIC image has transparency or you need pixel-perfect quality for design work, PNG is the better choice. PNG also has universal support across all platforms and design software, making it ideal for professional graphics and logos. JPG is better for photographs without transparency where file size optimization is more important than perfect quality."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is HEIC to PNG conversion free and secure?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze is completely free forever with no hidden costs, subscriptions, or advertisements. Most importantly, all conversion happens locally in your browser using WebAssembly-powered HEVC decoder technology. Your HEIC files never leave your device—they're never uploaded to any server, ensuring 100% privacy and security for your iPhone photos."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I convert multiple HEIC files to PNG at once?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze supports batch conversion of up to 100 HEIC files per session. You can drag and drop multiple HEIC files at once, and they'll all be converted to PNG format simultaneously with transparency preservation. There are no individual file size limits, so you can convert large HEIC files without restrictions."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will my EXIF data be preserved when converting HEIC to PNG?",
      "a": "Yes, Toolaze preserves all EXIF metadata during conversion, including GPS coordinates, shooting date, camera settings, and other metadata tags. Your converted PNG files will retain all the original metadata from your HEIC files, ensuring no information is lost during conversion."
    },
    {
      "q": "What's the difference between HEIC and PNG format?",
      "a": "HEIC is Apple's modern format using HEVC encoding, offering 50% smaller files than JPG with superior quality, and supports transparency and HDR. However, HEIC has limited compatibility—primarily supported on Apple devices. PNG is a lossless format with universal support, perfect pixel-level quality preservation, and full alpha channel transparency, making it the industry standard for graphics and professional design work. PNG files are typically larger than HEIC but guarantee compatibility everywhere."
