When you export product photos from professional cameras or design tools, they often exceed 10MB, causing upload failures and frustrating 'File is too large' errors in Seller Central. Large image files not only get rejected by Amazon but also slow down your product page loading speed, hurting conversion rates and potentially affecting your search rankings. Amazon's algorithm favors listings that load quickly, especially on mobile devices where most shoppers browse. Our browser-based compressor uses intelligent Canvas API processing to reduce your product image file sizes while preserving the visual quality and zoom capability that drives sales."
