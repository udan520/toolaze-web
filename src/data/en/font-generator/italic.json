        "title": "What is Italic Font?",
        "text": "Italic fonts use Unicode Mathematical Italic characters—distinct Unicode symbols that create slanted, emphasized letterforms. Unlike CSS-styled italic text, these Unicode characters work consistently across all platforms, including email, documents, and plain text environments. Italic fonts are characterized by their emphasis effect, making them perfect for academic citations, book titles, document emphasis, and any text that needs to stand out while maintaining readability.
