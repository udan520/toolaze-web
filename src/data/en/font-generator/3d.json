        "text": "3D fonts use Unicode characters with bold, dimensional styling that creates a three-dimensional appearance. These typefaces feature thick strokes and visual depth, making text appear to pop off the page or screen. 3D fonts are characterized by their modern, dimensional look, making them perfect for video game titles, architectural visualizations, 3D design projects, and any content that needs that contemporary, depth-filled aesthetic.
