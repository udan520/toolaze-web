Your photos, your location data, and your memories never leave your hard drive.\n\nWhile HEIC (High Efficiency Image Format) is excellent for saving storage space on your iPhone, it remains a major headache for Windows users, legacy web platforms, and professional editing software. Toolaze bridges this gap. Our engine translates Apple's advanced HEVC encoding into the universally accepted JPG format without sacrificing visual fidelity. By optimizing this process locally, we eliminate the 2026 digital friction of \"unsupported file\" errors, ensuring your high-res photography is ready for sharing, printing, or professional web deployment immediately."
